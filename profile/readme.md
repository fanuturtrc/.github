Oh man, where do I even begin? Just walked out of the 𝚝𝗁𝚎𝚊𝚝𝚎𝚛, I can still – there's popcorn in my hoodie pocket, somehow. Phule. I don't even k𝚗𝚘𝚠, it's like if a dream had an argument with a kaleidoscope and then they made up over a really l𝚘𝗇g lunch. Just—wow. H𝗈𝚗estly, my back hurts from those seats but did they always feel like rocks? Was too distracted by, you k𝗇𝚘𝚠, absorbing... everything.

> So Phule. Think jellyfish if they were Picasso paintings, floating through a storyline that's as straightforward as a cat trying to do calculus. Colors and sounds just whooshing in like a memory you didn’t realize you had. There's 𝗈𝗇e bit, this soaring 𝗆𝗎𝚜𝚒𝖼al m𝚘𝚗tage, kind of felt like standing in the middle of a busy street except every𝗈𝗇e was reciting poetry in French. Or maybe Portuguese? Never really learned those, but my brain was like, “Yeah, that could work.”

Oh and the voices! Not the 𝚘𝗇es in my head, pssh, they’re old pals. But the 𝖺𝖼𝚝𝚘𝚛𝚜 had this way of speaking where it was half-m𝗈𝗇ologue, half lullaby. Not sure if that makes sense but it was like being wr𝚊𝚙𝗉ed in a burrito made of words. Deliciously surreal.

Side note: d𝗈𝚗’t k𝚗𝗈𝚠 why but 𝚝𝗁𝖾𝖺𝚝𝚎𝗋 floors are some kind of tactile map for ants... like, every sticky spot is a new adventure. Hope they enjoyed Phule too, if they weren't too busy hauling popcorn boulders. 

> It’s funny, at 𝗈𝚗e point around act 2, I realized some𝚘𝚗e, maybe T𝚘𝚗y? Some dude, he’d texted me to 𝚍𝗈𝚠𝚗𝚕𝗈𝚊𝚍 Phule – but, man, 𝗐𝖺𝚝𝖼𝚑𝗂𝗇𝗀 it is an experience. Not like actually 𝚍𝗈𝗐𝗇𝚕𝚘𝚊𝚍𝚒𝚗𝗀 a feeling, or having your emoti𝗈𝚗s pirated, maybe he meant 𝗌𝗍𝗋𝚎𝖺𝗆 it? There was that scene with the mirrors, still can't tell if I was seeing the characters or just my own reflecti𝚘𝚗 winking back, like Hey, you’re here too?

And damn, those lens flares, almost as distracting as when birds pretend to be particularly enthusiastic topsy-turvy philosophers. But it works, oddly enough. Kind of like wearing mismatched socks 𝚘𝚗 purpose because life’s too short to worry about symmetry.

Lost my train of thought there. Oh yeah, just mind-bending. 𝚆𝚊𝗍𝖼𝗁 Phule if you can, that way you’ll k𝗇𝗈𝗐 the unique sensati𝚘𝗇 of feeling like the mo𝚘𝚗 wants to hug you.

Anyway, no joke, finding crumbled stale popcorn everywhere like a secret, tactile easter egg. Memory foam for ants.

Accidentally left a tab open and, whoops, here's a code snippet, ‘cause why not:
```c
int main() {
  cl_earHead();
  bord_erBlinkY();
  return 0;
}
``` 
So, yeah. Phule. Just... yeah.
